# Pan-Card-Tempering-Detection
This project is TAMPERING OF PAN CARD using Computer Vision. It will help different organization in detecting whether the id i.e the pan card provided to them by their employees or customers or anyone is original or not.

# How It works
> - [1] GET IMAGES FROM USERS
> - [2] CHECK FOR SIZE AND FORMAT OF THE IMAGE
> - [3] CHANGE SHAPE AND SIZE OF IMAGE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL IMAGE
> - [4] CONVERT THE IMAGE TO GRAYSCALE
> - [5] FIND THE SIMILARITY INDEX OF THE IMAGE
> - [6] FINDING THE THRESHOLD OF THE IMAGE
> - [7] FINDING CONTOUR AND GRAB THOSE CONTOUR USING IMUTILS
> - [8] DRAW A BOUNDING RECTANGLE USING THESE CONTOURS
> - [9] PLOT DIFFRENCE, THRESHOLD, ORIGINAL AND TAMPERED IMAGE
> - [10] COMPARE ALL THE IMAGES AND CHECK THE SIMILARITY SCORE TO DECIDE TAMPERING
